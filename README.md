I was *supposed* to fit some time in for this coursework on Linear Algebra and Computation

Basically the course takes you through working by hand
*gasp paper and pen/pencil*
and understanding concepts in 
Matrix Multiplication and Vector Mathematics =>concepts like 
Least Squares and Eigenvalues/Eigenvectors, etc, before understanding
how it applies to software. From there, the applications are in Matlab.

A close mathematician friend said that he knew the guy who teaches the 
coursework, and recommended it to me, so I'm doing a bit of the coursework
here and there when I can.
