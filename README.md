*The associated repo has a similar title, and will contain notes and homework assignments solved.*


*Please bear in mind that I am also learning TeX, so the notes may not be perfect or the cleanest.

ABOUT:

I was *supposed* to fit some time in for this coursework on Linear Algebra and Computation.

Basically the course takes you through working by hand *gasp* paper and pen/pencil* and understanding concepts in 
Matrix Multiplication and Vector Mathematics =>concepts like 
Least Squares and Eigenvalues/Eigenvectors, etc, before understanding
how it applies to software. From there, the applications are in Matlab.

A close mathematician friend said that he knew the guy who teaches the 
coursework, and recommended it to me, so I'm doing a bit of the coursework
here and there when I can.
